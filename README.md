sample for "useEffect" and "useRef"
I want the focus() event to happen on the "input" when I enter the program
In JavaScript, we first give an identification symbol such as class or ID to the input, and then execute the program on it as described below.â†“ 

const element = document.querySelector(".input")

element.focus();

But this is completely wrong in reactjs
Because these were SideEffects, we are not allowed to do this in RenderLogic
